# gg
Command line google search - like googler - except it actually works.  ;-)

So, I got tired of getting the dreaded "No results." from googler, so I tried to fix it - gave up after a few minutes and figured it'd be easier to just re-write the thing myself.

usage:

gg <your search text>

...

Title:  <result #3 title>
Snippet:  <result #3 summary text>
Link:  <result #3 url>

Title:  <result #2 title>
Snippet:  <result #2 summary text>
Link:  <result #2 url>

Title:  <result #1 title>
Snippet:  <result #1 summary text>
Link:  <result #1 url>

Notice:  Results are in reverse order.  Because errrm... because I say so.
